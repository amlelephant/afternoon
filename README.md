afternoon was supposed to be a cure for social media. I had the idea that if I could condense all feeds into one place I could ultimately create a time saver. This is being put on my repo much after it was created. Looking back on it now it would have never worked because I don't think social media companies would be too happy about the website taking users off their site. I still think this was a good dive into full stack development and really developed my skills in a lot of areas. Pretty good logo too, ig I was a pretty good designer in junior high lol.
